The Warewulf project is pleased to announce the release of v4.5.0, [now
available on GitHub][1].

[1]: https://github.com/warewulf/warewulf/releases/tag/v4.5.0

This release includes many bug fixes, several new features (some in active
preview), and an improved test suite.

We're very excited to get this release out, following the success of our
release candidate process; but please don't hesitate to [let us know][2] if you
encounter any issues. We [intend][3] to continue to improve and maintain the
v4.5.x line, particularly its documentation, while we begin working on v4.6.0,
expected later in 2024.
